Added:

- Sparkles: Stardust Resource Pack
- Village Taverns (RPG Series)
- Enchanting Infuser
- Universal Enchants
- Universal Ores

Fixes/Changes:

- Vanilla villages can spawn again since RPG structures spawn there (Cannot figure out how to configure Structure Pool API to inject these into Lukiâ€™s villages)
- Changed recipe of lodestones from netherite ingot to iron ingot
- Change default vanilla tweak settings to remove crop xp (since it does not support modded crops)
- Looting and fortune grants more xp
- Infinity no longer requires an arrow like spell infinity
- Removed might, blowthrough, and tri-shot from Dungeons and Taverns but all bow and crossbow enchantments are compatible with each other
- Horse armour and wolf armour can be enchanted
